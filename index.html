          <h2> Tana River Delta   </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Tana River is Kenya's largest river. Its source is the Aberdare Mountains and the craggy snow-covered peaks of Mount Kenya. Having travelled over 1,000 km the river spreads out across a massive floodplain. As it does so it creates a maze of tidal creeks and mangrove swamps, salt marshes and doum palm islands. There are bush-covered dunes and grassland. North of Malindi, where the Tana River meets the Indian Ocean, you will not only find a beautiful untreated landscape, but also a 67-kilometre-long unspoilt sandy beach and a diverse animal and bird life. This is where the Tana River meets the Indian Ocean, offering the ultimate bush & beach experience. Delta Dunes is neither a safari lodge nor a beach resort – the lodge combines both in a unique way, in the style of a Robinson Crusoe getaway. After an exciting day in the bush, you can unwind on the beach or enjoy the endless feeling of freedom that the lodge exudes with its open construction. Each of the seven cottages are built on sand dunes and are open on all sides. No doors, no walls, just breathtaking views of the sea, the dune landscape or the river delta. Only local materials were used for the decoration. All these elements make Delta Dunes a very special hideaway that is rarely found anywhere else. Go on a fishing trip in the delta and catch your own dinner. Spend the day water skiing, surfing and kayaking, or take a boat-safari into the wetlands to see countless crocodiles and hippos. To chill out, head to the pool with its fantastic view over the dune landscape or to the endlessly long beach, which you share exclusively with the other guests of the lodge – the best form of relaxation you can enjoy at Delta Dunes Lodge. The hideaway also leaves nothing to be desired in terms of culinary delights: Your palate will be spoiled with fresh fish and seafood caught in the morning by the fishermen of the nearby village. Accompanied by a good glass of wine, the magnificent view over the wild dunes and the gentle sound of the waves of the Indian Ocean as background music – it almost doesn‘t get any better than this. 
      
          </p>
          <h2>Wildlife of the Tana Delta </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            This is the Tana Delta, a conservation area of 50,000 hectares. The main river is clad in stretches of thick riverine forest with fig and palm trees. Explorable by boat trips these forests are teaming with interesting birdlife and often shelter buffalo, elephant, hippo and crocodile as well as a host of smaller, shyer antelope and primates. The Pokomo and Orma are the two main tribes in the area. They have very different backgrounds and cultures and both are very hospitable, welcoming prior arranged visits to their villages.
          </p>
          <h2>The Pokomo tribe</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Pokomo are the majority tribe and their lives revolve around the river and its flooding cycles which irrigate their fields and nurture the mango trees that shade their villages.
          </p>

          <h2> The Orma tribe</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Orma are Ethiopian by origin and are traditionally pastoralists moving their beehive shaped dwellings across the floodplains wherever the grass for grazing takes them. The beach is a long curve of sand, flanked by dunes on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other. Water birds and crabs scuttle across the sand. The sea is warm and the surf roles across a gently slopping beach so you can choose the size of wave you wish to tackle.

          <h2>Tana River Primate Reserve</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
             The Tana River Primate Reserve, which is known to the local people as Mchelelo, was formed to protect two endangered species of monkey; the crested mangabey and the Tana River red colobus. It is also one of the last remaining relics of the once massive Central African Lowland Rainforest, but became isolated from the rest of the forest during the seismic eruptions that caused the formation of the Rift Valley. As a result, much of the reserve's flora and fauna are unusual to East Africa and bear traces of ancient links to the Congo Basin forests of the Miocene period. Climate: generally hot and dry. Average rainfall ranges between 400 and 500mm per annum. Precipitation is concentrated in one main season, May - June. Average monthly temperatures range from 20 to 40 degrees Centigrade. Due to the presence of human settlements the reserve has a network of tracks and roads. These can, however, become inaccessible due to flooding; and 4WD is recommended at all times. The rare and seriously endangered, Tana River red colobus is one of 14 separate species of colobus, distributed across Africa. A relatively large member of the colobus family, the Tana River red is an elusive and exclusively arboreal and diurnal monkey, which lives in the evergreen closed canopy of the gallery forest, where it subsists on young leaves, fruit and flowers. Living in groups of approximately ten individuals the Tana River red colobus actually appears predominantly grey. It has a black face, conspicuous whiskers and the only red colouration on its body is the slight rufous tinge on the top of its head. Other primates found here include Sykes and vervet monkey yellow baboon and three types of bushbabies. There are also 57 species of mammal including; lion, giraffe, buffalo, blue monkey, baboon, Grevy's and Burchell's zebra, oryx, lesser kudu and various squirrels. There is also a small seasonal population of the endangered Hirola antelope (also known as the Hunter's hartebeest), while on the eastern side of the reserve there is possibility of seeing elephants. The reserve is also home to over 260 bird species including the extremely rare white-winged apalis. Mchelelo Research Camp

          <h2>Secluded Africa</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Secluded Africa are the owners and managers of exclusive and barefoot luxury lodges in Kenya. These lodges include Delta Dunes, Kipalo Hills, Sunbird Lodge, Instinct of the Mara and Cardamom House. These lodges are located in Kenya. The core focus of Secluded Africa is Wildlife and Nature conservation and culture and communities. The lodges are run entirely by locals and they are the most friendly and helpful people you will meet. The <b>Tana River Delta</b> in Kenya is one of the largest and most significant coastal delta ecosystems in Eastern Africa. In order to protect the outstanding diversity of nature here in the face of a changing climate and economy, we support local pastoral, agricultural and fishing communities to manage their wetlands and maintain water resources in a sustainable manner. The <b>Tana Delta</b> consists of an impressive variety of freshwater, floodplain, estuarine and coastal areas with extensive mangroves, intertidal areas and pristine beaches, forming a large and very productive coastal ecosystem. As a result, it was recently designated as Kenya’s 6th  Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The <b>Tana Delta</b> is rich in nature, supporting several highly threatened species of animals and plants, including five species of threatened marine turtles, the IUCN red-listed African elephant, and three species of monkey. The delta supports tens of thousands of wetland birds, making it one of the key sites in the country for waterbird conservation. The delta supports over 100,000 people who practice pastoralism, agriculture and fishing, and depend on the delta’s ecosystem.

Walking with an armed guide can provide a thrilling experience and there is something very uplifting approaching wildlife on foot. Apart from this, walking allows you the chance to see and learn about all the little things in the bush, such as medicinal plants, tracks and spoor, the insects and their whole symbiosis with nature and the world.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            We all know what romantic means. It’s being somewhere, with someone, in a setting which makes your heart flutter a little more than usual. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a honeymoon, or a special occasion. Romance is experiencing something magical together. It is safe to say that a safari experience exudes romance – almost every aspect of your day ticks a multitude of romantic boxes. Be it star gazing on the sundowner hill at Instinct of The Mara, taking a picnic lunch and heading out in the bush – with only nature in sight, a campfire romance with a colourful sunset over Mt. Kilimanjaro at Kipalo Hills or a private candlelit dinner on a secluded beach with the gentle rustle of palm trees and waves of the Indian Ocean as background music – we have got you covered.
